          Now that I'm in College, I need to think about what I want to do with my life. 
          After I graduate, I intend to attend college and see if I can earn some college credits. 
          I want to try to become what I've always wanted to be: a race car driver. After college, 
          this would be my first choice for a career. First, I'd look into what classes and credits 
          I'd need. I want to be more than just a race car driver. I want to be a member of the 
          Nascar racing team and one of the best racers. I'm aware that the majority of the races t
          ake place in Daytona Beach. Florida and is far from home, but I have to do what I want to 
          get what I want in life. MotoGP is my favorite sport, and the majority of the people I 
          know are involved in it in some way. The majority of my friends all ride. Hopefully, 
          the sport will be the foundation of my future career. MotoGP is the type of sport 
          where everyone knows everyone else and there is a big community. MotoGP is also one 
          of the riskiest sports. On any given day, a rider can crash, and that crash can 
          either end their career or allow them to pick themselves up and continue riding. 
          I'll do this because I want to represent my country, the Philippines, and I want 
          Pilipinos to be proud of me for doing so. I'll need a bachelor's degree in computer 
          science to work as a computer programmer. I plan to take programming classes in 
          high school and excel in math. A software developer may work in a variety of fields, 
          including game design, application development, healthcare, cybersecurity, and systems 
          development. My primary interest is in game design. I read the information and used 
          it to better understand the profession. My uncle and grandfather are also in this line 
          of work, and I've picked up some tips from them. Finally, I want to be a computer programmer 
          because I enjoy creating games. I enjoy playing video games and would like to learn how to 
          create my own. I already know a lot about programming and would like to learn more. Throughout 
          my life, I aspired to be a successful businessman and create something amazing and valuable 
          for my future lifeâ€”something that would make my family much happier than it is now. After 
          all these exhausting years of study, I am ready to fight for my dreams and help others'make
           the world a better place.'My father is a farmer who sells wheat after it has been harvested. 
           It's our family business, but I'm not interested in carrying on the family tradition. 
           I don't want to confine my operation to four walls. I have some big ideas that I'd like 
           to expand on. Following a family business is simple, but being an entrepreneur adds a new 
           level of excitement to it. I intend to sell my saris on the international market. I plan 
           to create an online portal as well as an app. This will allow me to easily connect with 
           people while also dealing with various fashion industries. All these things are totally 
           new, even for me and also for my family, but I want to make my parents proud and see me 
           successful. I am not afraid of taking risks but I am also determined.
