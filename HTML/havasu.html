<p id="desc">Havasu Falls is the most famous of the aqua-blue Havasupai Waterfalls that 
  <br>spill over deep-orange, travertine cliffs in a desert oasis of stunning beauty. 
  <br>The stark contrast between the arid desert landscape of the Havasu Canyon and the 
  <br>lush vegetation near the water is a juxtaposition of harsh desert and a sumptuous 
  <br>tropical paradise. The five Havasupai Falls include: Navajo Falls, Fifty Foot Falls, 
  <br>Havasu Falls, Mooney Falls and Beaver Falls. All are located on the Havasupai Indian 
  <br>reservation in a side canyon of the Grand Canyon. The waterfalls of the Grand Canyon
  <br>are like no other in the world, and visiting them is the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
